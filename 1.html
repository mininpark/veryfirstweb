  <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
  <p>
  <strong><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/" target="_blank" title ="html specification">
    HTML5</a></strong> is a <u>software solution stack</u> that defines
    the properties and behaviors of web page content by implementing a markup-based pattern to it.
  HTML5 was the fifth and last major version of HTML that is a World Wide Web
  Consortium (W3C) recommendation. The current specification is known as the HTML
  Living Standard and is maintained by a consortium of the major browser vendors
  (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft), the Web Hypertext Application
  Technology Working Group (WHATWG).</p>

    HTML5 was first released in public-facing form on 22 January 2008,
    with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014.
    Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia
    and other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and
    consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers,
    etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible
    with older software. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4,
    but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.[5] </p>
